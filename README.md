==========

Check out project's GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/x43x61x69/Swift-UUID).


Description
-----------
*The source code served as an example, it is, by no means, a commercial grade product. It might contain errors or flaws, and it was created for demonstration purpose only.*

**Swift UUID** is a sample project to demonstrate how you can generate UUIDs with Swift, ported from [OpenUUID](https://github.com/x43x61x69/OpenUUID) which was written in Objective-C.

Currently **Swift UUID** supports the following UUID formats:

* **Random UUID:** `e.g. D6050BE9-63DE-4EA2-B625-90BD0E90552B`
* **Hardware UUID:** Hardare UUID that can be found in the system profiler.
* **System Serial Number:** Hardware serial number that can be found in the "**About this Mac**" window.

More information about UUID can be found on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier).

*Plases note that, Swift is still in beta stage, the API might be different when it's released this fall with OS X Yosemite.*
